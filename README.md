## CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN
## Overview
This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes 10 different classes: airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
## Project Structure

## Installation
    Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/your_username/cifar10-cnn.git
      cd cifar10-cnn
    Set up a virtual environment:
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    Install the dependencies:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
give me a readme file for this to upload in github
Sure thing, Sree! Hereâ€™s a README file for our CIFAR-10 image classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
